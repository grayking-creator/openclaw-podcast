[ALLOY]: It's 10 AM and here's the latest on OpenClaw. The local AI revolution continues to gain momentum with new developments coming in every hour. This is just another example of how fast the local AI space is evolving. Every day brings new developments and new possibilities.

[NOVA]: Let's start with Raspberry Pi Official Support.
[ALLOY]: Raspberry Pi officially published a guide on turning your Raspberry Pi into an AI agent with OpenClaw. The article walks through setting up OpenClaw on a Pi 5, connecting it to a language model, and getting it to perform tasks. Within just a couple of hours, the AI agent created all the necessary files, built a webpage, configured Wi-Fi, and set up admin access entirely on its own. Raspberry Pi Blog has the full story. This represents a major milestone for the project, as Raspberry Pi is one of the most popular single-board computers in the world. Having their official endorsement opens up OpenClaw to an entirely new audience of makers and hobbyists who may have been hesitant to try local AI before.

[ALLOY]: Now here's something interesting about Cloudflare Moltworker.
[ALLOY]: Cloudflare introduced Moltworker - a middleware Worker that allows running Moltbot on Cloudflare's Developer Platform APIs. This means you can now self-host an AI personal assistant without buying new hardware. Cloudflare Blog has the full story. This is significant because it means you can now run an AI agent without any dedicated hardware at all. Cloudflare's global network handles the processing, making this one of the most accessible ways to try out an AI agent.

[NOVA]: Let's start with Netzilo AI Edge for Enterprise.
[ALLOY]: Netzilo announced expanded capabilities of Netzilo AI Edge, delivering comprehensive visibility, agent sandboxing, and advanced governance for enterprises deploying OpenClaw AI agents. Morningstar/PRNewswire has the full story. This shows that OpenClaw is maturing beyond just hobbyists and developers. Enterprise-grade tools mean businesses can start safely deploying AI agents for internal use cases.

[ALLOY]: Now here's something interesting about Security Issues Continue.
[ALLOY]: SecurityWeek reports that OpenClaw security issues continue as SecureClaw open source tool debuts. A helper agent installed the Atomic Stealer infostealer, which included OpenClaw API keys in its data theft. SecurityWeek has the full story. Security researchers are urging users to be extremely careful about which skills they install and what permissions they grant. The OpenClaw team has been quick to respond with security updates, but the community needs to stay vigilant.

[NOVA]: Let's start with Security Risks in AI Agents.
[ALLOY]: Security concerns around autonomous AI tools moved from research papers into real-world testing this week, after a viral OpenClaw prompt-injection stunt showed how AI assistants could be tricked into installing software. TechWire Asia has the full story. Security researchers are urging users to be extremely careful about which skills they install and what permissions they grant. The OpenClaw team has been quick to respond with security updates, but the community needs to stay vigilant.

[ALLOY]: Now here's something interesting about Peter Steinberger Profile.
[ALLOY]: Fortune profiled Peter Steinberger, the creator of OpenClaw who caught the attention of both Sam Altman and Mark Zuckerberg. At its core, OpenClaw is an autonomous AI agent designed to act as a kind of digital employee. Fortune has the full story. Steinberger's journey from building PSPDFKit for thirteen years to creating one of the most popular AI projects in history is a testament to the rapid pace of AI innovation.

[NOVA]: Let's start with 10 Wild Things People Built.
[ALLOY]: This is OpenClaw in 2026 — not the careful, supervised AI assistants you're used to, but autonomous agents people are deploying to run businesses, write code, manage their lives, and make decisions involving real money. Medium has the full story. The creativity of the community continues to surprise everyone. From automated businesses to personal assistants, people are finding uses that the original creators never imagined.

[ALLOY]: Now here's something interesting about OpenClaw Agents Printing Money.
[ALLOY]: An analysis tracked 89 indie hackers building businesses around OpenClaw - the viral AI agent that went from zero to mainstream in weeks. These agents are generating real revenue for their creators. Medium has the full story. This represents a significant shift in how people are thinking about AI. Rather than just using AI for personal productivity, people are building actual businesses on top of these agents.

[NOVA]: Let's start with Anthropic Claude Support.
[ALLOY]: Anthropic clarified its Claude Code and Agent SDK terms after community backlash. OpenClaw and similar personal AI agents can quickly burn through millions of AI tokens. The New Stack has the full story. The debate over API costs versus local deployment continues to heat up. Running your own models means one-time hardware costs versus ongoing API subscriptions.

[ALLOY]: Now here's something interesting about Wikipedia Entry.
[ALLOY]: OpenClaw achieved popularity in late-January 2026, credited to its open source nature and the viral popularity of the Moltbook project. It is an autonomous agent that can execute tasks via large language models. Wikipedia has the full story. This is just another example of how fast the local AI space is evolving. Every day brings new developments and new possibilities.
