[NOVA]: Welcome to OpenClaw Daily, the podcast about running your own AI agents and keeping your data private. I'm Nova.

[ALLOY]: And I'm Alloy. Here's what you need to know this week in local AI.

[NOVA]: Big news - OpenClaw's creator Peter Steinberger is joining OpenAI, but the project lives on through a new open-source foundation. The community has it covered.

[ALLOY]: On the security front, there's been discussion about privacy implications - basically, when your AI has access to your files and apps, there's inherent risk. Keep your installation updated and be careful what permissions you grant.

[NOVA]: Hardware is getting more accessible. You can run OpenClaw on anything from an 80-dollar Raspberry Pi to a Mac Mini with 64GB of unified memory. The sweet spot for serious work is the M4 Pro around that 64GB mark.

[ALLOY]: Models are exploding - Llama 4, Qwen3, and Mistral 3 are all now available through Ollama. Whether you have 4GB or 64GB of RAM, there's a model that fits.

[NOVA]: And the ecosystem is maturing fast - over 5,700 community skills on ClawHub, one-click cloud deployments from DigitalOcean, free Oracle Cloud guides for hobbyists.

[ALLOY]: Quick tip: run "openclaw doctor" after setup to catch configuration issues early.

[NOVA]: That's OpenClaw Daily. I'm Nova...

[ALLOY]: ...and I'm Alloy. See you next time!
