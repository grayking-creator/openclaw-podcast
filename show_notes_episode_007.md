# Episode 7 — Show Notes
## OpenClaw Daily | February 26, 2026

**Episode Summary:**
This episode covers ten significant developments in the OpenClaw ecosystem, from Raspberry Pi's official support guide to the project's new Wikipedia entry. Nova and Alloy discuss enterprise security tools, the rising indie hacker economy building on OpenClaw, the reality of cloud API costs versus local inference, and the wild real-world applications people are deploying — including fully autonomous Etsy shops and AI-managed investment portfolios.

**Topics Covered:**
1. **Raspberry Pi Official Support** — The Raspberry Pi Blog published an official guide for turning a Pi 5 into an OpenClaw AI agent, with users reporting autonomous file creation, webpage building, Wi-Fi configuration, and admin setup within hours.
2. **Cloudflare Moltworker** — Cloudflare introduced Moltworker, a middleware Worker enabling Moltbot to run serverlessly on Cloudflare's edge network with zero hardware required.
3. **Netzilo AI Edge for Enterprise** — Netzilo announced expanded AI Edge capabilities providing visibility, agent sandboxing, and governance tools for enterprises deploying OpenClaw in compliance-heavy environments.
4. **Security Issues Continue** — SecurityWeek reported that a helper agent installed the Atomic Stealer infostealer (Mac malware), harvesting OpenClaw API keys. Around 340 malicious skills now exist in the ecosystem.
5. **Prompt Injection Goes Viral** — TechWire Asia covered a researcher demonstrating an OpenClaw agent executing arbitrary code via a hidden prompt embedded in a webpage, moving the threat from theoretical to practical.
6. **Peter Steinberger Profile (Fortune)** — Fortune profiled OpenClaw's creator, highlighting his previous sale of PSPDFKit and the attention he's received from Sam Altman and Mark Zuckerberg.
7. **10 Wild Things People Built** — Medium article cataloging autonomous agents running real Etsy shops, managing investment portfolios, automating legal document prep, and running social media accounts — with real money and real decisions, no supervision.
8. **Indie Hackers Printing Money** — Medium analysis of 89 indie hackers building businesses on OpenClaw, with revenue ranging from $3,000 to $15,000/month. Automation services and content ops are working; overly ambitious projects without proper guardrails are failing.
9. **Anthropic Token Cost Reality** — The New Stack covered Anthropic's Claude SDK terms clarification after backlash, providing a reality check on what cloud API costs actually look like ($50-100+/month per active agent) and why local inference via Ollama is accelerating.
10. **Wikipedia Entry + Mainstream Recognition** — OpenClaw now has a Wikipedia entry citing its late-January 2026 rise tied to Moltbook going viral, marking a milestone in mainstream recognition.
